## 🚨 Anomaly Types & Attack Scenarios

### 1. **BRUTE FORCE ATTACK** 
**Severity:** 🔴 HIGH  
**Attack Type:** Automated Password/Key Guessing

**What it detects:**
- Excessive rapid decryption attempts (>10 per minute)
- Automated tools trying multiple keys/passwords rapidly
- Typical brute-force password cracking behavior

**Indicators:**
- ⚡ Multiple decrypt attempts in short time window
- 📊 Exceeds normal threshold significantly  
- 🎯 Pattern: Machine-driven rapid requests
- 📍 High risk of unauthorized access

**What this means:**
Someone (or a bot) is trying many different passwords/keys very quickly to break into encrypted messages.

**Recommended Action:**
- 🛡️ Rate limit the user immediately (max 1 attempt per 5 seconds)
- 🔐 Require multi-factor authentication
- 📝 Log IP address for investigation
- 🚫 Consider temporary account suspension

---

### 2. **CREDENTIAL STUFFING** 
**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Attack Type:** Account Takeover Using Stolen Credentials

**What it detects:**
- Multiple failed decryption attempts over extended period (>5 per hour)
- Using lists of leaked passwords from other breaches
- Systematic credential testing

**Indicators:**
- ❌ High number of failed decrypt attempts
- 🔑 Pattern: Trying known compromised passwords
- 🌐 May come from specific IP addresses
- 💥 Account compromise in active progress

**What this means:**
Attackers have obtained password lists from other data breaches and are testing them against your account to see if you reused passwords.

**Recommended Action:**
- 🚨 Lock account immediately
- 🔄 Force password reset
- 📧 Notify user via email/SMS
- 👮 Alert security team
- 🔍 Check for other compromised accounts from same IP

### 3. **TIMING SIDE-CHANNEL ATTACK**
**Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Attack Type:** Cryptographic Side-Channel Analysis

**What it detects:**
- Unusual variance in encryption/decryption timing (>30%)
- Attempts to measure how long operations take
- Statistical timing pattern analysis

**Indicators:**
- ⏰ Significant deviation from normal operation time
- 📈 Suspicious timing variance patterns
- 🎯 Attack method: Inferring keys from operation speed
- 🔍 Measuring encryption time to guess key bits

**What this means:**
Advanced attackers measure how long encryption takes to guess information about the encryption keys. Different keys may cause different processing times.

**Recommended Action:**
- ⚙️ Add random timing jitter (50-100ms delays)
- 🔐 Use constant-time cryptographic algorithms
- 📊 Monitor for timing correlation patterns
- 🛡️ Implement timing attack countermeasures

---

### 4. **TRAFFIC ANALYSIS ATTACK**
**Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Attack Type:** Pattern Recognition & Message Fingerprinting

**What it detects:**
- Repetitive message sizes (low diversity ratio <20%)
- Messages with identical lengths repeatedly
- Pattern-based message identification

**Indicators:**
- 📦 Too many messages with same size
- 📊 Low message size diversity
- 🎯 Analyzing patterns to identify message types
- 🔍 Fingerprinting encrypted communications

**What this means:**
Even though messages are encrypted, their sizes can reveal patterns. An attacker might identify "yes/no" answers, login attempts, or message types just by looking at encrypted message lengths.

**Recommended Action:**
- 🛡️ Enable message padding (add random bytes)
- 📦 Use fixed-size message blocks
- 🎲 Add random dummy traffic
- 🔀 Randomize message transmission timing

- Patterns suggesting CPU cache measurement
- Automated rapid-fire requests

**Indicators:**
- ⏱️ Operations happening extremely fast (milliseconds)
- 🎯 Method: Measuring CPU cache hits/misses
- 🔍 Analyzing cache behavior to extract keys
- 💥 Possible key extraction through hardware timing

**What this means:**
Highly sophisticated attack that exploits how CPUs cache data. By sending rapid requests and measuring tiny differences in response time, attackers can infer secret key bits.

**Recommended Action:**
- 🛡️ CRITICAL: Implement strict rate limiting (1 req/sec max)
- ⚙️ Use constant-time cryptographic operations
- 🔄 Add cache-line flushing after sensitive operations
- 🚨 Monitor for automated attack tools

**Attack Type:** Cryptanalysis Through Pattern Analysis

**What it detects:**
- Suspiciously regular encryption timing patterns
- Periodic operations at fixed intervals
- Automated cryptanalysis attempts

**Indicators:**
- 🔁 Operations happening at regular, predictable intervals
- ⏰ Pattern: Every X seconds like clockwork
- 🎯 Encrypting known data to analyze cipher behavior
- 📊 Automated, scripted attack pattern
- 💥 Risk: Finding weaknesses in encryption algorithm

**What this means:**
Attackers encrypt known messages (messages they wrote) repeatedly to analyze how the encryption algorithm works, looking for patterns or weaknesses they can exploit.

**Recommended Action:**
- 🛡️ URGENT: Rotate encryption keys immediately
- ⏱️ Add random delays (1-5 seconds)
- 🔍 Monitor for correlation attacks
- 🔐 Check encryption algorithm strength
- 📝 Review recent encryption operations

### 7. **SESSION HIJACKING ATTEMPT**
**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Attack Type:** Session Token Theft

**What it detects:**

- Session token switching patterns
- Account access from stolen sessions

**Indicators:**

- 🎯 Attack: Stealing or predicting session tokens
- 🔍 Method: Cookie theft, XSS, or session fixation
- 🌐 Different session tokens from different sources
- 💥 Unauthorized account access in progress

**What this means:**
Someone has stolen or guessed your session cookies/tokens and is using them to access your account without knowing your password.

**Recommended Action:**
- 🚨 IMMEDIATE: Invalidate all active sessions
- 🔄 Force user to re-login
- 🔐 Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)
- 📝 Log all IP addresses
- 🔍 Check for XSS vulnerabilities
- 👮 Review session management security

- Geographically impossible location changes
- Suspicious geographic patterns

**Indicators:**
- 🌐 Multiple different IP addresses in short time
- 📍 Locations that are physically impossible to travel between
- 🎯 Attack: Account takeover or credential sharing
- 🔍 Method: Compromised credentials used from multiple locations
- 💥 Account security breach likely

**What this means:**
Your account is being accessed from multiple locations that you couldn't physically travel between in the time available. Either your account is compromised, or credentials are being shared.
