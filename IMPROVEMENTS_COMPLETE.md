# ✅ Anomaly Detection System - Improvements Complete

## 🎯 Issues Resolved

### ❌ Problem 1: Anomaly Types Not Mentioned
**Before:** Generic warnings like "unusual pattern" without specifying WHAT kind of attack
**Solution:** Every anomaly now has a specific attack type classification:
- Cache Timing Attack
- Session Hijacking  
- Chosen-Ciphertext Attack
- Known-Plaintext Attack
- Impossible Travel
- Message Interception
- Recipient Enumeration
- ML-Detected Anomaly
- And more...

### ❌ Problem 2: Same Caution for Sender and Receiver
**Before:** Same generic "caution" message whether user is sending or receiving
**Solution:** Role-specific detection and warnings:
- **RECEIVER attacks** - Focus on inbox access, message reading, decryption attempts
- **SENDER attacks** - Focus on message sending, encryption, recipient probing  
- **MIXED attacks** - Full account compromise affecting both capabilities

## 📋 What Was Changed

### 1. Enhanced `ai_encryption_validator.py`

#### Session Anomaly Detection (`_check_session_anomalies`)
```python
# Now detects role and provides specific warnings:
- session_hijacking_receiver   → Attacker reading your messages
- session_hijacking_sender     → Attacker sending as you
- session_hijacking_mixed      → Complete account takeover
- impossible_travel_receiver   → Reading from multiple locations
- impossible_travel_sender     → Sending from multiple locations
- impossible_travel_mixed      → Full compromise
```

#### Timing Attack Detection (`_detect_timing_attacks`)
```python
# Separated into sender/receiver attacks:
- cache_timing_attack_receiver → Extract decryption keys
- cache_timing_attack_sender   → Analyze encryption patterns
```

#### Pattern Attack Detection (`_detect_pattern_attacks`)
```python
# Different attack types for each role:
- known_plaintext_attack_sender      → Break encryption algorithm
- chosen_ciphertext_attack_receiver  → Extract decryption keys via oracle
```

#### ML Anomaly Detection (`_detect_ml_anomalies`)
```python
# Role-specific ML classifications:
- ml_unusual_receive_pattern → Unusual message reading behavior
- ml_unusual_send_pattern    → Unusual message sending behavior
```

### 2. Enhanced `templates/status.html`

#### Visual Improvements
- **Role Badges**: Color-coded badges show attack target
  - 📤 SENDER ATTACK (purple gradient)
  - 📥 RECEIVER ATTACK (pink gradient)
  - 🔄 MIXED ATTACK (yellow gradient)
  - 🤖 ML-DETECTED (blue gradient)

- **More Details**: Shows 5 indicators instead of 3
- **Better Labels**: 
  - "Attack Details" (was "What This Means")
  - "Defense Actions" (was "How to Counter")

## 🔍 Example Improvements

### Session Hijacking

**BEFORE:**
```
🚨 SESSION HIJACKING
🔀 Multiple sessions: 5 unique session IDs
⚠️ IMMEDIATE: Invalidate all sessions
```

**AFTER (for receiver):**
```
🚨 RECEIVER SESSION HIJACKING: Attacker trying to hijack session to READ your incoming messages
📥 RECEIVER ATTACK

👤 User Role: RECEIVER
🔀 Multiple sessions detected: 5 unique session IDs
📊 Recent activity: 2 sends, 15 reads
💥 Risk: Attacker gains access to 15 incoming messages in your inbox

🛡️ Defense Actions:
Invalidate all sessions immediately, force re-login, enable 2FA for message reading, 
review which messages were accessed
```

**AFTER (for sender):**
```
🚨 SENDER SESSION HIJACKING: Attacker trying to hijack session to SEND messages on your behalf
📤 SENDER ATTACK

👤 User Role: SENDER
🔀 Multiple sessions detected: 5 unique session IDs
📊 Recent activity: 12 sends, 3 reads
💥 Risk: Attacker could send 12 unauthorized messages pretending to be you

🛡️ Defense Actions:
Invalidate all sessions immediately, force re-login, enable 2FA for sending, 
notify your contacts of potential impersonation
```

### Cache Timing Attack

**BEFORE:**
```
⚡ CACHE TIMING ATTACK
⏱️ Rapid operations: 3 in <100ms
🛡️ CRITICAL: Implement rate limiting
```

**AFTER (for receiver):**
```
⚡ RECEIVER CACHE TIMING ATTACK: 3 rapid decryption attempts in <100ms intervals
📥 RECEIVER ATTACK

👤 Role: RECEIVER (attempting to read encrypted messages)
⏱️ Rapid decrypt operations: 3 in <100ms each
📊 Total decrypt attempts: 8 in 5 minutes
🎯 Attack type: Cache timing side-channel on decryption keys
🔍 Method: Measuring CPU cache hits/misses during decryption to extract private keys
💥 Risk: CRITICAL - Could extract receiver's private decryption key, 
        allowing attacker to read ALL past and future messages

🛡️ Defense Actions:
Implement strict rate limiting (max 1 decrypt/sec), use constant-time decryption algorithms,
enable CPU cache-line flushing, rotate decryption keys immediately, add random timing jitter,
consider hardware security module (HSM)
```

### ML Detection

**BEFORE:**
```
ML model detected unusual encrypt pattern
Anomaly score: -0.35
Investigate event details
```

**AFTER:**
```
🤖 ML-DETECTED SENDER ANOMALY: Unusual message encryption/sending pattern
📤 SENDER ATTACK  🤖 ML-DETECTED

👤 User Role: SENDER
🤖 ML Anomaly score: -0.35 (more negative = more unusual)
⏱️ Operation duration: 125.45ms
🎯 Activity type: message encryption/sending
🔬 Detection method: Isolation Forest ML model (100 estimators)
💡 What this means: Unusual pattern in how messages are being SENT - 
                    may indicate bot activity, spam automation, or account compromise

🔍 Defense Actions:
Review recent sent messages, verify account ownership, check for spam/bot activity,
monitor recipient patterns
```
