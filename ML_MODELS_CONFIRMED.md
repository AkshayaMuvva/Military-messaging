## Machine Learning Implementation

YES, the real-time threat assessment system **DOES have actual machine learning models**:

### 🤖 ML Models Implemented:

#### 1. **Isolation Forest** (Anomaly Detection)
- **Library**: scikit-learn
- **Purpose**: Detects anomalous threat patterns
- **Algorithm**: Unsupervised learning for outlier detection
- **Contamination Rate**: 10% (expects 10% of data to be anomalies)
- **Estimators**: 100 trees
- **Status**: ✅ **TRAINED**

#### 2. **Random Forest Classifier** (Threat Classification)
- **Library**: scikit-learn  
- **Purpose**: Classifies threats into 5 levels (safe, low, medium, high, critical)
- **Algorithm**: Supervised ensemble learning
- **Estimators**: 100 decision trees
- **Max Depth**: 10 levels
- **Status**: ✅ **TRAINED**

#### 3. **Standard Scaler** (Feature Normalization)
- **Library**: scikit-learn
- **Purpose**: Normalizes features for better ML performance
- **Status**: ✅ **FITTED**

## ML Feature Engineering

The system extracts **10 features** from each threat assessment:

```python
Features = [
    1. Total indicator count
    2. Average confidence score
    3. Maximum severity level  
    4. Type diversity (unique indicator types)
    5. Critical severity count
    6. High severity count
    7. Medium severity count
    8. Low severity count
    9. Attack indicator count (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
   10. Behavioral indicator count (unusual time, new IP, etc.)
]
```

## Training Process

### Automatic Training:
- ✅ Collects training data from every threat assessment
- ✅ Auto-trains when 50 samples are collected
- ✅ Re-trains every 100 new samples for continuous learning
- ✅ Saves models to disk for persistence

### Model Persistence:
- **Anomaly Model**: `threat_assessment_model.pkl`
- **Feature Scaler**: `threat_assessment_scaler.pkl`
- **Auto-loads** on system startup if models exist

## ML-Enhanced Threat Detection

### How It Works:

```
1. Request arrives
   ↓
2. Extract 10 ML features from threat indicators
   ↓
3. Scale features using StandardScaler
   ↓
4. Isolation Forest predicts if anomalous
   ↓
5. Random Forest predicts threat level
   ↓
6. Combine with rule-based analysis
   ↓
7. If ML detects anomaly → 20% risk score boost
   ↓
8. Use ML prediction if more severe than rules
   ↓
9. Return final assessment
   ↓
10. Add to training data for continuous learning
```

### ML Anomaly Boost:
When ML models detect an anomaly:
- Risk score increased by **20%**
- Console shows: `🤖 ML Anomaly Detected! Score: X.XXX, Predicted: level`
- Threat level upgraded if ML predicts higher severity

This provides the **best of both worlds**: fast, reliable detection of known threats, plus adaptive learning for unknown/emerging threats.
