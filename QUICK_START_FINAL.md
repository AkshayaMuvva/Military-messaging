1. Login as `alice`
2. Click **"Send Message"**
3. Enter:
   - Recipient ID: `bob`
   - Message: `Hello Bob! This is a quantum-encrypted message.`
   - TTL: `5` minutes (message auto-destructs after 5 min)
4. Click **"Send Encrypted Message"**
5. **Copy the secure link** shown in the success message

7. **Note**: Message auto-destructs after reading!

### Step 6: Check Security Status

1. Click **"System Status"** in the navigation
2. View:
   - Quantum crypto status
   - AI metadata protection stats
   - Real-time threat assessment
   - Security signals
   - Active sessions

## 🔒 Key Features in Action

### 1. Quantum-Resistant Encryption
Every message uses:
- ✅ Kyber KEM (post-quantum key exchange)
- ✅ Dilithium (post-quantum signatures)
- ✅ Signal Protocol (classical layer)
- ✅ ChaCha20 encryption

### 2. AI Metadata Protection
Automatically:
- ✅ Scrubs identifying metadata
- ✅ Adds random send delays
- ✅ Generates decoy traffic
- ✅ Prevents timing analysis

### 3. Self-Destructing Messages
Messages:
- ✅ Stored only in volatile memory
- ✅ Auto-destruct after reading
- ✅ Expire after TTL
- ✅ Secure multi-pass memory wipe

### 4. Adaptive Encryption
System automatically:
- ✅ Monitors threat level
- ✅ Adjusts encryption strength
- ✅ Increases iterations under attack
- ✅ Adapts to evolving threats

### 5. Real-Time Threat Detection
Continuously:
- ✅ Monitors user behavior
- ✅ Detects anomalies
- ✅ Blocks malicious IPs
- ✅ Can trigger emergency shutdown

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Basic Messaging
```
1. Register alice and bob
2. alice sends message to bob
3. bob reads message
4. Verify message disappears after reading
```

### Test 2: Message Expiration
```
1. Send message with 1 minute TTL
2. Wait 2 minutes
3. Try to read - should show "Message Destroyed"
```

### Test 3: Data Persistence
```
1. Register user
2. Stop application (Ctrl+C)
3. Restart application (python app.py)
4. Login with same user
5. Should work! (db.key persists data)
```

### Test 4: Emergency Wipe
```
1. Send some messages
2. Go to Status page
3. Click "Emergency Wipe"
4. All messages instantly destroyed
```

## 📊 Understanding the Logs

### Normal Operations:
```
✅ Encrypted database initialized  → Database ready
✅ Quantum session created         → Secure channel established
🔄 Encryption adapted: low -> low  → Threat level assessed
```

### Security Events:
```
🚨 Security Alert                  → Potential threat detected
🔥 INTRUSION DETECTED             → Critical threat, auto-blocking
⚠️ THREAT DETECTED: high          → High risk activity identified
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "User not found"
**Solution**: Make sure you registered first. Data persists, so once registered, you can login again after restart.

### Issue: "Invalid session ID"
**Solution**: This has been fixed! The quantum crypto now uses shared instances.

### Issue: "Decryption failed"
**Solution**: This happens if db.key was deleted/changed. The key is now persistent.

### Issue: Can't read old messages after restart
**Solution**: Messages are designed to self-destruct! They only exist in memory. This is a security feature, not a bug.

### Issue: Tor warnings
**Solution**: Application works perfectly without Tor. Tor is optional for additional anonymity.

## 🎓 Advanced Usage

### View Quantum Crypto Details
Check `/status` page for:
- Active quantum sessions
- Encryption parameters
- Threat assessment scores
- Metadata protection stats

### Emergency Features
- **Emergency Wipe**: Instantly destroys all messages
- **Auto-Shutdown**: Triggers on critical threats
- **IP Blocking**: Automatic blocking of malicious IPs

### Monitoring
Watch the console for real-time security events:
```
📊 User data structure: ...
🔄 Encryption adapted: ...
🚨 Security Alert: ...
```

## 📁 Important Files

| File | Purpose | Backup? |
|------|---------|---------|
| `db.key` | Database encryption key | ✅ YES! Critical |
| `flask_secret.key` | Session secret | ✅ YES! |
| `secure_data.db` | Encrypted user data | ✅ Recommended |

**⚠️ WARNING**: If you lose `db.key`, all user data is permanently unrecoverable!

## 🎉 Success Indicators
